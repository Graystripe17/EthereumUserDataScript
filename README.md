# EthereumUserDataScript
Simple User Data Script for quickly mining ethereum on nVidia (Ubuntu 16.04). Useful for cloud mining on spot instances. Feel free to create your own AMI with this, I am not responsible for any losses.

Use the bash_history script when prompted for user data. user-data.txt was the old version for previous AMIs. On a g2.2x instance you can expect ~4.7Mh/s, which is kinda bad, so make a fleet.
